## Description
"Morikawa" is an Arduino Mega compatible mission OBC for INVADER. INVADER is the first art satellite in the world launced on 27th Feb, 2014 as a piggyback satellite of H-IIA F23 rocket.

We developed original libraries and application for Morikawa and they worked very well on orbit. The creative user program for Morikawa can be developed using familiar Arduino IDE.

We also developed original software for grand station of INVADER at Tama Art University (TamabiGS). Tamabi GS can also provide telemetry data of INVADER through ARTSAT API.
