## Description
"Morikawa" is an Arduino Mega compatible mission OBC for INVADER. INVADER is the first art satellite in the world launced on 27th Feb, 2014 as a piggyback satellite of H-IIA F23 rocket.

We developed original libraries and application for Morikawa and they worked very well on orbit. The creative user program for Morikawa can be developed using familiar Arduino IDE. 

We also developed original softwares for grand station of INVADER at Tama Art University (TamabiGS). They are written by oF. Tamabi GS can also provide telemetry data of INVADER through ARTSAT API (http://api.artsat.jp).

## Link to Prototype

- MorikawaSDK: Arduino libraries for Morikawa
- MorikawaApp: Sample programs for Morikawa (They are equipped on INVADER.)
- iva: Simple assembler for INVADER VM, INVADER VM (http://goo.gl/UEJRd0) is implemeted as one of the above Morikawa App to reprogram Morikawa by uploading arbitrary bytecode from TamabiGS.
- ground_station: Softwares for TamabiGS
- ofxARTSATAPI: An openFrameworks addon to obtain INVADER's telemetry data.
